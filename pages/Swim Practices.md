# About the Workouts

Different Strokes Calgary accommodates both recreational and competitive swimmers. Coaching is offered to assist with technique and fitness development. However, swimming at one’s own pace and comfort level is always encouraged.

## Beginning Swimmers

Beginning swimmers are encouraged to come out and learn how to swim. Our coaching staff are top notch with many years of teaching and coaching experience. They enjoy introducing new swimmers to the sport.

## Competitive Swimmers

Participants with a competitive outlook will benefit from a structured and progressive goal oriented workout programme.

## What to Bring

Swimmers will need to bring a swimsuit and towel. Goggles and a swim cap are highly recommended although not required. You can bring your own lock for the locker room. It is recommended that valuables be left at home or brought with you on the pool deck.

## What to Expect

Laps in the pool. When you arrive on deck at the pool you will be welcomed. Choose the lane appropriate to your level of swimming. Lane 1 is for beginners and lane 6 is for advanced swimmers. Lane 2 to 5 are varying degrees between beginner and advanced swimmers.

After swim practice is a nice cool down in the hot tub where announcements will be made. Usually team members will go for dinner after practice and everyone is welcome.

## Swim Meets

All swimmers are welcome in every masters meet. There are no minimum requirements, as Master’s swimming is about fun, participation, and fitness.

Swim practices focus on swimming technique and building swim fitness. Technique emphasizes ongoing development of the following strokes: freestyle (front crawl / Australian crawl), back stroke, breast stroke, and butterfly.

# Swimming Etiquette

In order to best facilitate smooth, cooperative, and fun swim workouts, there are some time-honoured rules of the pool that we respect:

- Help set up the pool for workouts. Put in lane ropes, get out the kick boards, pull-buoys, etc.
- If you are late, warm up on deck or in a vacant lane, then start the workout at the same point the rest of the swimmers in your lane have reached.
- Swim in a circle within each lane, staying off the centre line. Usually, alternate lanes swim clockwise and counterclockwise. This is so you will be swimming alongside people going in the same direction, which helps reduce collisions.
- Within a lane, swimmers should arrange themselves for each set with the fastest swimmer leading and the slowest at the back. It is the lead swimmer’s duty to ensure that the lane keeps to the pace time.
- Allow 5 or 10 seconds between you and the swimmer ahead of you when swimming repeats.
- If you need to pass another swimmer (especially in a distance set, 400 metres or more), touch the toes of the swimmer (once!) as a signal that you wish to pass. The swimmer ahead should pause at the end of the length and allow you to pass.
- As you approach the wall for a turn, cautiously ease over so that you can push off in a straight line.
- Swim the workout as given/posted/directed. Don’t initiate your own workout unless others in your lane and the coach agree. If you are not doing the same thing as the rest of your lane, do not interfere with what they are doing, swim ahead, behind, or move to another lane.
- When resting at the end of the pool, move to the side of the lane so that others may turn freely without fear of injuring you or themselves.
- At the end of the workout, help put away the equipment.
- Don’t be afraid to smile. Smiles are contagious.
